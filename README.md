This TicTacToe game is written in Javascript.
In the tictactoe.js file I have created the TicTacToe class. The constructor takes three params:

- rows: the number of rows
- columns: the number of columns
- cellsToWin: the number of cells in a specific line occupied by one player in order to win

This makes the game flexible and it is possible to use different matrix.

In the index.js file I'm instantiating the tictactoe class, making the moves and logging out the results.

I have used Mocha to test the game. I have tested all the methods used in the titactoe class.
